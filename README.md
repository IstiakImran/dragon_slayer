# Warrior vs. Dragons

A 3D game where you, a courageous warrior, fight against mighty dragons in a vast, open world.

## Description

This is a 3D game built with Python and OpenGL. You play as a warrior prince, and your mission is to defeat the dragons that have invaded your land. The game features a large, procedurally generated world with trees, rocks, and other obstacles.
